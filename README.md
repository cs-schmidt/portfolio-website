## Description

This repository hosts the codebase for my personal
[portfolio website](https://cs-schmidt.dev). The website is a single-page
application (SPA) built using HTML, SASS, JavaScript, React, and Three.js. Some
of its key features include smooth-scrolling animations, typing effects, and a
3D particle driven background.
