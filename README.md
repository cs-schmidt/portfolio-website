## Description

This repository hosts the codebase for my personal portfolio website. The
website is a single-page application (SPA) built using HTML, SASS, JavaScript,
React, and Three.js. Some of its key features include smooth-scrolling
animations, typing effects, and a 3D particle driven background. The live
version can be found at [cs-schmidt.dev](https://cs-schmidt.dev).
